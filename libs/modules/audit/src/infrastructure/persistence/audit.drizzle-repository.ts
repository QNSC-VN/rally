   * `(workspace_id, actor_id)` with no `occurred_at`, so the actor filter already sorts one
   * actor's rows rather than seeking — bounded by that actor's volume, which is why it was
   * acceptable to ship without one. Neither is added here (a migration number was owned
   * elsewhere this round); both are recorded so the next migration can take them together.
