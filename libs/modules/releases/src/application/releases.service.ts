   * assigned US/DE/Feature after assignment from Backlog/Work Item Detail **or Portfolio Feature**".
   * This module never touched `portfolio_items`, so a Feature assigned to a release showed that
   * release on the Feature, survived a reload, and the release's Artifacts tab reported `0 items` —
   * `GAP-P3-REL-002`. The seed has had `FE-1 → RE-1` since it was written, so every environment
   * displayed the fault. The work-item half is unchanged, down to `type IN ('story','defect')`:
   * tasks live in `work.tasks` and carry no release, and an Epic is project-level with no Release
   * field, so `portfolio_items.release_id` is a Feature's column in practice as well as by rule.
   *
   * TWO BRANCHES, NOT ONE PER-BRANCH PAGE. Each branch fetches `limit + 1` under the SAME keyset
   * predicate and the same `ORDER BY`, and the merge below takes `limit + 1` of the UNION. That is
   * exact, not approximate: any row among the union's next `limit + 1` is among its own branch's next
   * `limit + 1`. A per-branch `limit` would be a silent truncation instead — the Feature would
   * reappear only to push a Story off the page. The count sums both branches because they are
   * disjoint by construction (two tables, two id spaces).
   *
   * `assigneeName` is joined because the shared artifact table renders an Owner column and had
   * nothing to fill it with — the SPA's own row type declared the field, the feed never sent it. On
   * the portfolio branch the Owner is `owner_id`, which is that table's name for the same column.
