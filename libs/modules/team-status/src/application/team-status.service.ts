     *
     * THE ROSTER IS THE COMPLETE LIST OF NAMED GROUPS (GAP-P3-TS-008, P0)
     *
     * Read BEFORE the tasks are grouped, because it decides how they are grouped. Any task assignee
     * NOT on it used to be folded in here (`if (!memberInfo.has(userId)) memberInfo.set(...)`), which
     * gave an outside-team owner their own named group carrying 0h capacity — the BA's rule is
     * "Team Status shows only ACTIVE members of the Team selected in the top filter … no
     * outside-Team member group appears".
     *
     * Their WORK still counts. `getTaskRows` scopes tasks by
     * `coalesce(task, parent, iteration).team_id`, with no owner predicate, and that scope is
     * correct: the task IS this team's commitment whoever happens to own it. Dropping the row would
     * make this surface understate the team's hours and would put it back out of step with Team
     * Capacity, which the two read as one population
     * (`test/e2e/team-status-agreement.e2e.spec.ts` pins the totals).
     *
     * So an off-roster owner's task lands in the UNASSIGNED bucket — the same 0h-capacity residual
     * group the AC already gives a null-owner task. Nothing is hidden by that: FR-027's Owner column
     * on each task row still prints the real owner's name, so "who owns this" stays on screen; what
     * the row no longer gets is a ROSTER entry with a capacity to plan against, which is exactly the
     * distinction the AC draws. Deliberately not a synthetic "outside this Team" group either — that
     * needs response shape and copy the BA has not written, and a bucket keyed on non-membership is
     * the thing the second half of the rule refuses.
