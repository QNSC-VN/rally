/**
 * Refuses a request that is itself authenticated by an API token.
 *
 * Applied to the routes that mint, list and revoke tokens. Without it a leaked token is not one
 * credential but a credential factory: the holder mints a fresh token with a new expiry, and revoking
 * the one you found changes nothing. GitHub applies the same rule to personal access tokens for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * Deliberately a guard and not a check inside the service: the property is "how was this request
 * authenticated", which is an HTTP-layer fact, and putting it in the service would let a future caller
 * reach the service by another route and skip it.
