 * not reconcile the totals against any of the three buckets.
 *
 * Applied to Features and to leaves alike, deliberately: eligibility has to be counted in the

 * so the per-Team totals do not sum to the All Teams total — which is already this report's
 * contract (`release_daily_snapshots.team_id IS NULL` is a MEASURED All Teams row, never a sum).
