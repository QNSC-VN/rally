/**
 * Refuse to boot if any HTTP route handler declares no authorization.
 *
 * WHY AT BOOT AND NOT IN THE GUARD
 * --------------------------------
 * `PolicyGuard` also denies an undeclared route now, but it can only do that where it is
 * MOUNTED — and the two decorators a forgotten route most likely carries, `@Public()` and a
 * bare class-level `@Auth()`, do not mount it. So a guard-only fix would leave exactly the
 * case it was written for untouched.
 *
 * A boot check has no such blind spot: it reads every controller's metadata directly, so the
 * question is not "did the guard run" but "did anyone decide". And it fails at deploy time
 * rather than when a caller probes the endpoint, which is the difference between a failed
 * rollout and a quiet data leak.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS DECLARED — one of four, and no default:
 *   `@RequirePermission(code, scope?)`  a permission, resolved from the database
 *   `@Public()`                         no principal exists yet (login, refresh, HMAC webhook)
 *   `@SelfScoped(reason)`               the subject IS the caller
 *   `@AuthorizedInService(reason, test)` resolved at run time, pinned by a named test
 *   `@AuthzGap(reason)`                 a KNOWN missing check, counted by the ratchet
 *
 * Class-level metadata counts, because `Reflector.getAllAndOverride` reads handler then class
 * — a controller-wide `@RequirePermission` really does cover its handlers, and reporting them
 * all would be 100 false positives.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a warning. A warning on a security control is a control that is off: it
 * scrolls past in a deploy log and the endpoint stays open. `test/route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts`
 * is the fast static check for the same property; this is the one that cannot be bypassed by
 * a scanner's regex missing a decorator shape.
 *
 * A LIFECYCLE HOOK, NOT A FUNCTION CALL IN bootstrapApp. Two reasons, both learned the hard
 * way here:
 *   - Controllers are not instantiated until `app.init()`, and `bootstrapApp` runs before it
 *     to register Fastify plugins. Called there, the scan found ZERO routes and the floor
 *     below fired — a check that would have reported "all clear" without that floor.
 *   - As a hook it runs for EVERY application that imports AccessModule, including the e2e
 *     harness, with no call site anyone can forget to add. A security control wired by
 *     convention is the shape of every "declared but not enforced" bug in this repo.
