  /**

   *
   * Content-Type and Content-Length are bound into the signature, so the bucket
   * rejects an upload that declares a different type or exceeds the declared
   * size — enforcement happens at the edge, not after the fact.
   *
   * The SHA-256 checksum is deliberately NOT sent by the client.
   *
   * An earlier version passed `ChecksumSHA256` and listed
   * `x-amz-checksum-sha256` in `signableHeaders`, intending the bucket to reject
   * a mismatched body. The presigner silently ignores it: the emitted
   * X-Amz-SignedHeaders is `content-length;content-type;host` in every variant
   * tried (command input, build-step header injection, and
   * finalizeRequest + unhoistableHeaders). The client then sent an x-amz-* header
   * the signature did not cover, S3/R2 rejected it 403, and because that error
   * response carries no CORS headers the browser surfaced it as an opaque
   * "Failed to fetch" — every upload failed.
   *
   * The digest the client computes is still stored on storage.files: it is the
   * dedup key and lets a background job verify content later. It is NOT enforced
   * at upload time. Anything claiming otherwise is wrong.
   *
   * Content-Disposition is baked in at PUT time so it is stored as object
   * metadata and therefore applies to EVERY later read — including a CDN read
   * that never passes through presignGet.
   *
   * ON THE RESILIENCE BUDGET (applies to presignGet too). Both presign methods run on
   * the request path with a user waiting, and both are deliberately LEFT on the
   * long-budget STORAGE preset rather than moved to STORAGE_INTERACTIVE, because
   * neither makes a network call: `getSignedUrl` is a local HMAC-SHA256 computation
   * over the canonical request, and the ~60s timeout it nominally sits under is
   * unreachable. The one theoretical exception is credential resolution — an
   * `S3Client` with no static credentials walks the provider chain, and in ECS that
   * means one HTTP call to the container credentials endpoint on first use, cached
   * thereafter. It does not apply to the deployed configuration: `STORAGE_ENDPOINT`
   * is set to R2 with static `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
   * so the chain is never walked. Changing these to the interactive budget would add
   * a retry to a pure function and buy nothing; if the AWS-S3 code path (no endpoint,
   * task-role credentials) is ever deployed, the FIRST presign of a process becomes a
   * network call and this decision should be revisited then.
