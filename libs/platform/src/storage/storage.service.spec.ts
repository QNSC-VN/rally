/**
 * These assert the CONTRACT BETWEEN the presigned URL and the headers the client
 * is told to send. That contract is invisible to type checking and was wrong in
 * production: presignPut advertised `x-amz-checksum-sha256` as required, but the
 * presigner never signed it. S3/R2 rejects an unsigned x-amz-* header with a 403
 * whose response carries no CORS headers, so the browser reported an opaque
 * "Failed to fetch" and every upload failed.
 *
 * Nothing else catches this — the SDK ignores the checksum silently, and no
 * mock-based test that stubs the SDK can see it. So these tests use the REAL
 * presigner and inspect the URL it emits.
