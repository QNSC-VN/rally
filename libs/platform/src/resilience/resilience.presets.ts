   * nobody waiting on it. AWS SDK has its own retry but we add a circuit breaker so a
   * full S3 degradation fails fast instead of queue-filling.
   *
   * The 60s budget is DELIBERATE HERE and wrong on the request path. Note also that
   * `maxAttempts` is cockatiel's RETRY count, not the total: `RetryPolicy.js` gates on
   * `retries < this.options.maxAttempts`, so `3` means four executions and the real
   * worst case is ~4 x 60s plus backoff, not 180s. A cron job that takes four minutes
   * to give up on one object is fine; a user holding an HTTP request for four minutes
   * is not. Use STORAGE_INTERACTIVE from the request path instead of lowering this.

  /**
   * Object storage on the SYNCHRONOUS request path, where a user is holding an open
   * HTTP connection for the whole thing. Currently `headObject` from
   * `AttachmentsService.confirm()`, which is the confirm step of an upload the browser
   * has already completed.
   *
   * WHY IT EXISTS. `confirm()` ran under STORAGE, so a Cloudflare R2 blip produced a
   * request that took MINUTES and then answered 200 (or 412, because `headObject`
   * swallows its error and returns null, which the service reads as
   * ATTACHMENT_NOT_UPLOADED). Invisible to the 5xx-rate alert — nothing failed — and
   * invisible in the latency histogram too, whose top finite bucket was 10000ms, so
   * 10s and 240s were the same number. Two presets rather than one lowered value
   * because the acceptable wait is a property of the CALLER: the reaper genuinely
   * wants to keep trying, and lowering STORAGE would have made a background job give
   * up on work nobody was waiting for.
   *
   * THE NUMBERS.
   *  - `timeout: 3_000`. A HEAD against R2 from the same region is single-digit
   *    milliseconds warm; 3s is roughly three orders of magnitude of headroom, so it
   *    fires only when the dependency is genuinely wedged rather than merely slow.
   *  - `maxAttempts: 1`. This is cockatiel's RETRY count (see the STORAGE note above),
   *    so it means two executions total — the initial call plus one retry. That is the
   *    "at most 2 attempts" this preset is specified for; writing `2` here would give
   *    three. One retry is worth having because the failure this exists for is
   *    usually a single dropped connection, and a second one is not: if two HEADs in a
   *    row cannot answer in 3s each, R2 is having an incident and a third attempt is
   *    just more of the user's time.
   *  - Worst case is therefore ~6.1s (2 x 3s plus the 100ms first backoff step),
   *    which lands under the ALB's 60s idle timeout with a wide margin and inside the
   *    7500ms histogram bucket, so a degraded confirm is now distinguishable from a
   *    healthy one instead of being clamped at the top of the range.
   *  - The circuit breaker keeps STORAGE's shape but halves `failureThreshold` to 3.
   *    Failing fast is worth more when someone is watching: three consecutive 3s
   *    failures is ~19s of evidence, after which every subsequent confirm answers
   *    immediately rather than each buying its own 6s. It is a SEPARATE circuit from
   *    STORAGE's by construction — `ResilienceService` caches policies by NAME, so the
   *    two budgets must never share a policy name (`StorageService.headObject`
   *    derives the name from the preset for exactly this reason).
