/**
 * Single source of truth for building AWS SDK client configuration.
 *
 * Two mutually-exclusive modes, selected by whether `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` is set:
 *
 *  - **Real AWS (prod / staging)** — `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` unset. Returns region
 *    only; the SDK resolves credentials from the ECS task-role / instance-
 *    profile provider chain. NEVER injects static keys here (least-privilege).
 *
 *  - **Local dev / CI (LocalStack)** — `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` set (e.g.
 *    http://localhost:4566). The default credential chain has no task role to
 *    resolve, so static credentials are passed explicitly. LocalStack accepts
 *    any value; the conventional `test`/`test` is used as a fallback.
 *
 * Reading from validated config (not `process.env`) is deliberate: `@nestjs/
 * config` only reliably surfaces schema-declared keys, so raw `process.env`
 * lookups return undefined in some processes (e.g. the worker) — which is the
 * exact reason endpoint/credentials were silently missing before.
