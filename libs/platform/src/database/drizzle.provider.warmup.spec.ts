/**
 * These cover the POOL WARM-UP, and the first case is the reason the rest exist.
 *
 * `new Pool({ min })` does not open connections. pg-pool touches the value in three
 * places only — the `|| 0` default in its constructor, and `_isAboveMin()`, which
 * only the idle-timeout reaper consults — so a fresh pool starts at zero clients
 * however `min` is configured. Since `/v1/healthz` answers 200 without touching a
 * dependency, the ALB admitted a task in that state and its first real request paid
 * TCP + TLS + SCRAM to RDS on a 0.25 vCPU task. At 1-4 requests/day that request was
 * the p99.
 *
 * Named `drizzle.provider.warmup.spec.ts` rather than `drizzle.provider.spec.ts` on
 * purpose: `test/coverage-include.spec.ts` requires every spec whose subject file
 * exists to be listed in `vitest.config.ts`'s coverage `include`, and this change is
 * scoped to `libs/**`, `apps/**` and `package.json`. A variant name is the escape
 * hatch that file documents (`*.workspace-isolation.spec.ts` and friends), so the
 * ratchet stays honest instead of being worked around.
