/**
 * Guards the single-store invariant.
 *
 * The observability package ships its own AsyncLocalStorage. If rally also had one,
 * HTTP requests would seed rally's store while the package's pino mixin read the
 * package's, and every request log line would quietly lose `workspaceId`, `userId`
 * and `correlationId`. Nothing throws in that world — the fields are simply absent,
 * which is why it needs a test rather than a comment.
