/**
 * The `text-ui-*` scale, pinned three ways.
 *
 * The tokens are declared as `rem` with the intended px in a trailing comment, and `html` pins the
 * root to an absolute 14px — so the comment is the only statement of what a reader actually sees, and
 * a rem edited without its comment (or a root changed without the tokens) silently moves every size in
 * the app. The first case recomputes each token against the real root rather than trusting either.
 *
 * The floor is 11px. `--text-ui-2xs` (9px) was retired on 2026-08-20: it was 32 nodes of badge and
 * meta text below anything the product it models renders, and keeping the token defined would let it
 * come back one class at a time.
 *
 * The root is a PERCENTAGE of the reader's own default, so "14px" here means "14px for the 16px
 * browser default" — the px comments are read the same way. An absolute px root would discard that
 * preference, which is what the literal `14px` this replaced did.
