/**
 * How a report names its scope, in one place for all four of them.
 *
 * Every Phase 6 UI contract spells the Team half of the scope the same way — Burndown's centred
 * context line is `{Project Name} - {Team Name|All Teams}` (IB §7), Velocity's is
 * `Team: {Team Name|All Teams}` (§6), Team Capacity's header is "report name and selected Team
 * scope" (§6), and Release Tracking's `All Teams` is a named scope in RT-BR-01. On the wire, that
 * scope is `context.teamName === null`.
 *
 * All four rendered it as `teamName ?? ''`. So the aggregate — the DEFAULT scope, the one a reader
 * sees first — printed as nothing: "NextGen Platform - ", "Team: ", "Team Capacity - ". A trailing
 * separator with an empty space after it reads as a value still loading, which is the one thing it
 * is not.
 *
 * A function rather than four call-site `??`s because the fallback is a TERM, and a term that
 * appears in four places drifts in four directions. `capacity.json` and `settings.json` already
 * spell it "All teams"; the SRS says "All Teams", and reports follow the SRS.

 * (real Rally collapses project and team; we do not), so most iterations name no team and belong to
 * every team in the project — the server counts those in a team-scoped report and it has to, or a
 * project running one shared sprint would report nothing at all.
 *

 * which fails in both directions: it offers another team's private sprint, where the report can only
 * answer with an empty chart, and it gives no sign that the shared sprints in the list are the ones
 * the numbers come from. Filtering here rather than asking the list endpoint for `teamId` is
 * deliberate — that filter is a strict `team_id = ?`, which drops exactly the shared iterations that
 * matter (SQL equality never matches NULL).
