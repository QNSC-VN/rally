/**
 * Access / permission hooks.
 *
 * Rally authorization is two-tier and purely additive:
 *  - BASELINE  = the union of the user's global + workspace role assignments.
 *    It's baked into the JWT and exposed via the auth store's `hasPermission`.
 *  - PER-PROJECT = baseline ∪ any role scoped to a specific project, resolved
 *    server-side and returned by `GET /v1/projects/:projectId/my-permissions`.
 *
 * Workspace-tier UI (navigation, settings) should keep using the auth store's
 * `hasPermission`. Project-scoped UI must use {@link useProjectPermissions} so a
 * user who is, say, admin of one project but only a viewer workspace-wide sees
 * the correct actions on that project.
