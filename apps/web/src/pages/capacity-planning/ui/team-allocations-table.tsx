/**
 * The nested table of Features allocated to one team — Rally's sub-table under an expanded row.
 *
 * A real table, not a run of rows borrowing the parent's columns: Rally renders it with its own
 * header, and it has to, because the columns mean different things one level down. The parent's
 * `Features` is a count and its `Capacity` is the ceiling a planner typed; a child row has neither
 * — it has an `Allocation`, the slice of that ceiling this Feature was promised. Continuing the
 * parent's headers put a child's allocation under a header reading "Capacity".
 *
 * Built from the same `useDataTable` + `DataTableFrame` as every grid in the app, so it resizes,
 * reorders and lays out identically to the table it sits inside. Every instance shares one storage
 * key on purpose: these are all the same table, so widening `Name` under one team widens it under
 * the next.
