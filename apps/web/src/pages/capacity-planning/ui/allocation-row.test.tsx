/**
 * P5-CP-025 — the `Allocation` cell on a team's nested Feature table.
 *
 * The cell reports a RELATIONSHIP: `from {team}` on a contributor row, `to {team}` / `N teams` on the
 * row that holds the assignment, and nothing to report when the Feature sits under its own team and
 * is allocated nowhere else. That last case rendered an EMPTY cell, which in a table where every
 * neighbour carries a value reads as "not loaded"; it now renders `EMPTY_VALUE`.
 *
 * `EMPTY_VALUE` is asserted through the constant, never as a literal `--`, and never as `—`: the BA
 * writes an em-dash in prose, the app renders `--` everywhere (see the constant's own docblock), and a
 * test that hardcoded either string would be the place that drift lands unnoticed.
