/**
 * A milestone's artifacts come from a POLYMORPHIC link table, so a row is either a work item or a
 * portfolio item and its detail surface differs. The discriminator is the row's own `type`:
 * `work_item_type` and `portfolio_item_type` are disjoint enums, which is why `TypeBadge` already
 * resolves a glyph for all five from one prop and why no extra DTO field is served for it.
 *
 * Duplicated from the release Artifacts tab on purpose — a `pages/` module must not import from
 * another `pages/` module, and two lines here is cheaper than promoting this into `entities/`.

/**
 * Milestone Artifacts — the dashboard rows PLUS the `Add Artifact` control (P3-MS-FR-028: "`Add
 * Artifact` follows the Backlog Story/Defect create/picker pattern and appends the current Milestone
 * relationship"). It was a read-only viewer, which left milestone membership reachable only by
 * opening each work item in turn — `GAP-P3-MS-001`, still an open P0 on the BA's branch, and the one
 * gap with a documented Rally analogue (Rally's milestone detail has its own Artifacts collection
 * page with `Add New` and a multi-select `Remove`).
 *
 * The picker writes the milestone end of the link (`PUT /milestones/:id/artifacts`, SRS §5.2), which
 * shares `assertArtifactsInMilestoneScope` with the work-item end — so an artifact that is legal from
 * the Work Item sidebar is legal here and vice versa. Removal is unticking: the payload REPLACES the
 * assignment list, and §4/AC-13 make removal affect nothing but that one relationship (Release,
 * Iteration, rank and item identity are untouched, which is true by construction because this write
 * only ever touches `milestone_artifacts`).
 *
 * Rally's row-level multi-select `Remove` is not reproduced: the table is the shared read-only
 * `ArtifactTable`, so a selection column would have to be added there for every surface at once.
