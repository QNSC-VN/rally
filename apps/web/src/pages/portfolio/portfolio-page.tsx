/**
 * Portfolio — the Epic / Feature list (BA spec §3.1–3.2).
 *
 * Rewritten for P5. The previous version assembled an Initiative → Feature → Story
 * tree on the client from work items of type `initiative`/`feature`; those types no
 * longer exist (migration 0072) and the hierarchy now lives in
 * `work.portfolio_items` with rollups computed server-side.
 *
 * Uses `ListPageScaffold` like every other list surface rather than the bespoke
 * flex-width grid it used to hand-roll, so column resize / reorder / show-hide,
 * selection and pagination behave identically to Releases and Iterations.
 *
 * This list is deliberately CROSS-PROJECT: a Workspace Admin sees every project's
 * portfolio, which is why there is no "select a project" gate and why Project is a
 * column. The API narrows rows to the caller's readable projects.
