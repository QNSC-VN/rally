/**
 * EntraGuestInviteRelayService — drains `messaging.guest_invite_outbox` and provisions each invited
 * external collaborator as a Microsoft Entra B2B guest via Graph, then writes the returned guest
 * `oid` back onto the invitation.
 *
 * Extends AbstractOutboxRelay, which owns the polling loop, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, the attempt
 * counter, the exponential backoff and the dead-letter log. Modelled on `EmailRelayService`; the
 * one thing it adds is `isPermanentFailure`, because a Graph REFUSAL (a malformed address, B2B
 * invitations switched off, a missing `User.Invite.All` grant) answers the same on all five tries
 * and belongs in `status = 'failed'` immediately rather than after fifteen minutes of retries.
 *
 * IT ALSO SCHEDULES THE INVITATION EMAIL (migration 0124), which is the ordering the invitee
 * depends on. `inviteMember` used to write both outbox rows and two independent relays drained them:
 * the email relay every 5s AND woken instantly, this one on a 30s cron with no wake signal. So the
 * link arrived in under a second and the Entra guest object up to 30s later, plus Microsoft's
 * directory replication — and an invitee who clicks immediately has nothing to authenticate against
 * (`NO_CONNECTION` from our login box, `AADSTS50020` from Microsoft's). The email is therefore
 * scheduled HERE, by the only component that knows the guest is ready, in the same transaction that
 * marks the row `sent`. That is why the docblock this replaced was wrong to call a directory write
 * "not latency-critical" on the grounds that "the invitee has a Rally email to act on either way":
 * the Rally email is UNUSABLE until the guest exists, so it must not exist any earlier.
 *
 * Cadence is 10s, not the SCM backfill's 30s, for that same reason — the wait is now the invitee's,
 * not a background job's — and `wakeGuestInviteRelay` makes the ordinary case immediate, with the
 * cron as the fallback for a missed publish. Still slower than the email relay's 5s because Graph is
 * rate-limited and a batch here is 10 directory writes.
