/**
 * CleanupCronService — periodic housekeeping for stale / soft-deleted rows.
 *
 * Runs daily at 01:00 UTC (stagger from snapshot cron at 00:00).
 * Purges:
 *   1. identity.auth_sessions that are revoked and expired >N days ago
 *   2. workspace.workspace_invitations that are still 'pending' but expired >N days ago
 *   3. storage.files that are unreachable — either presigned but never confirmed
 *      (older than 24 h), or soft-deleted, or no longer referenced by any link
 *      table. Deletes the object, then the row.
 *   4. scm.webhook_inbox rows that have been dealt with, past their retention
 *      window. Terminal rows are the whole table over time — see the constants.
 *
 * N is configured via SESSION_CLEANUP_OLDER_THAN_DAYS (default 7).

   *
   * `processed`/`ignored` rows are kept 30 days purely to answer "did we receive
   * that delivery?" during an incident. `failed` rows are kept far longer because
   * they are the dead-letter queue — each one is a link that never happened, and
   * deleting it destroys the only record. They are also self-limiting: a row only
   * reaches `failed` after 5 attempts, so healthy periods produce none.
   *
   * Bounded per run because each row carries the full webhook payload as jsonb
   * (~25 KB observed), so a first sweep over a long-neglected table would otherwise
   * be one very large transaction.

    // last reference has gone. Add a NOT EXISTS clause per new link table.

    // instance sized for 30 GB. It is bounded by activity, not by users: a busy repo
    // generates rows whether or not anyone opens rally.
    //
    // Only TERMINAL rows are eligible. `pending` is excluded no matter how old,
    // because a row waiting on backoff is still work owed — the relay retries with
    // exponentially increasing delays and a stalled queue must not be silently
    // truncated. `status` is the whole filter, not age alone.
    //

    // populates it: any other path to a terminal status would leave it NULL, and a
    // NULL comparison is false, so those rows would be retained forever by an
    // omission nobody would notice. received_at always has a default.
    //
    // Deliberately unindexed. ix_scm_inbox_pending is PARTIAL (WHERE status =
    // 'pending'), so this scans — which is the right trade for a once-daily sweep
    // over a table this keeps small, rather than paying index maintenance on every
    // webhook insert to speed up a job nothing waits on.
