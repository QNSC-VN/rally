/**
 * Keeps the coverage floors in `vitest.config.ts` honest.
 *
 * Ported from opshub's `test/coverage-floors.ts`, which exists because opshub's floors sat
 * 5-8 points below actual coverage while a comment claimed they were "set just below current
 * coverage" — nothing enforced that claim. Rally has the same failure mode, already
 * documented in this repo's CLAUDE.md ("Coverage is a ratchet, not a target"): the floors sat
 * ~11 points under real coverage for two phases (70/66/62/70 against 82/77/81/83), so a
 * ten-point regression would have passed. This is the automated version of the manual
 * discipline that note asks for.
 *
 * Two directions, both of which matter:
 *
 *  - a floor ABOVE actual means CI is already broken (vitest fails the run anyway, but this
 *    reports it as the configuration error it is rather than a mystery);
 *  - a floor more than `MAX_SLACK` points BELOW actual means the floor has stopped
 *    protecting anything, and the fix is to raise it in the same commit that raised
 *    coverage.
 *
 * Pure functions so the checker itself is unit-tested — a drift check that is wrong reads
 * exactly like a passing one.
