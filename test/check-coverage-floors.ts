/**
 * Compare the coverage floors in `vitest.config.ts` against the coverage actually measured.
 *
 * Run by `pnpm check:coverage-floors`, AFTER `pnpm test:cov` has written
 * `coverage/coverage-summary.json`. It cannot be a normal spec: this repo's own unit suite is
 * the thing being measured, so at the time the suite runs there is no report to read.
 *
 * Ported from opshub's `test/check-coverage-floors.ts` — see `coverage-floors.ts` for why
 * rally needs this too (rally/CLAUDE.md's "Coverage is a ratchet, not a target" section
 * documents having been burned by exactly this drift once already, caught only by hand).
 *
 * The comparison logic lives in `coverage-floors.ts` and is unit-tested — a drift check that
 * is quietly wrong looks exactly like floors that are fine.
