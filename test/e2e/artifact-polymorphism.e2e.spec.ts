/**
 * Two P0s of one shape: a relationship whose two ends are written by different surfaces and read
 * back by only one of them, over REAL HTTP.
 *
 *   • `GAP-P3-REL-002` — a release's artifacts live in TWO tables. `work_items.release_id` was read;
 *     `portfolio_items.release_id`, which the Portfolio Feature detail writes, was not. So a Feature
 *     assigned to a release showed the release on the Feature, survived a reload, and the release's
 *     own Artifacts tab reported `0 items`.
 *   • `GAP-P3-MS-002` — `milestone_artifacts` has been polymorphic on `(entity_type, entity_id)`
 *     since migration 0084 and the Feature/Epic detail rail writes `'portfolio_item'` rows. The
 *     milestone feed hardcoded `'work_item'`: two writers, one reader. Its inherited half was missing
 *     as well — a Feature or Epic on a milestone brings its leaf Stories/Defects into the milestone's
 *     display scope, once, without duplicate counting.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN E2E AND NOT A SERVICE SPEC. Both faults are in SQL that a mocked `db` cannot
 * execute, and both routes are gated: `release:view` and `milestone:view` are codes an Editor
 * deliberately does not hold (§3.2 marks the whole Timeboxes surface Hidden for one), so the read now
 * discloses `portfolio_items` fields through routes whose audience has to be checked rather than
 * assumed. Every role holding either code also holds `portfolio:view` (`db/permissions.catalog.ts`),
 * which is what makes the widened read safe — and the negative case below is what proves the audience
 * did not widen with the population. `task-routes.e2e.spec.ts` and `report-authz.e2e.spec.ts` are the
 * same shape for the same reason.
 *
 * The release half needs NO fixture write: the seed has assigned `FE-1` to `RE-1` since it was
 * written, so every environment has been displaying the fault. The milestone half links `EP-1` to
 * `MS-1` through the real Portfolio write path and puts it back afterwards, so the spec creates no
 * project and leaves the fixture as it found it.
