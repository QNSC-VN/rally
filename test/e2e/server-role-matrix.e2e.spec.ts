/**
 * THE BA's ACCESS MATRIX, MEASURED OVER HTTP, FOR ALL FOUR PRINCIPALS.
 *
 * `product-docs` `origin/main` (`55e7dbb`),
 * `projects/mini-rally/04_Developement_tracking/Phase 4/02_Roles_Permissions/SRS.md`:
 *   §3.1 (lines 59-71) company + structure administration
 *   §3.2 (lines 77-87) delivery features
 * Both tables have four columns — Workspace Admin, per-project `Admin`, per-project `Editor`,
 * and No Access (§1:31, the ABSENCE of a `work.project_members` row; there is no `Viewer`).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Only Workspace Admin has ever really been exercised: it is the local dev
 * principal and the seed's default, and its `workspace:*` grant is the global anchor that fast-paths
 * every check. That masking is how the `report:view` bug survived to migration 0092, how
 * `GET /work-items/by-key` shipped carrying an admin-reserved code, and how `iteration:view` came to
 * gate a surface §3.2 hides. `route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts` reads SOURCE TEXT, so it cannot tell a
 * correct code from a misspelled one or from one the intended role cannot hold; a spec that calls a
 * service directly cannot see a guard defect at all. This drives real HTTP with real Bearer tokens
 * and records the STATUS CODE each of the four principals actually gets.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A PROBE — three properties every one of them must have:
 *
 *   1. BOTH DIRECTIONS. A refusal alone is satisfied by a route nobody can reach, and a grant alone
 *      by a gate that grants everyone. Every row below asserts allow AND deny.
 *   2. THE VALIDATION PIPE RUNS BEFORE THE GUARD. An incomplete query or body is a 400 that never
 *      reaches authorization, so it would make either expectation pass for the wrong reason. Every
 *      payload here is schema-valid.
 *   3. DENIED IS `403`, AND `403` ONLY. Anything else — 404, 409, 422 — means the guard let the
 *      caller THROUGH and the request then failed on its own merits, which is what "allowed" means
 *      for a probe deliberately aimed at an unresolvable dependent id (see below). So the assertion
 *      is always `status === 403`, never `status >= 400`.
 *
 * HOW THE WRITE PROBES AVOID MUTATING THE SHARED FIXTURE. Two shapes, and the choice is per route:
 *
 *   • CREATE-THEN-DELETE, where the same principal holds both codes (work items, iterations,
 *     releases, milestones). The allow direction is a real 201 and the row is removed again, so the
 *     probe is self-cleaning and measures the delete code too.
 *   • VALID SHAPE, UNRESOLVABLE DEPENDENT, where no delete exists (capacity plans, Team Status
 *     capacity, portfolio create, and every structural §3.1 write). The guard for these routes
 *     resolves the project from `projectId` in the body/query — or ignores the path id entirely for a
 *     workspace-tier code — so a real `projectId` plus a bogus dependent id reaches the guard,
 *     passes or fails there, and then dies in the service with 404/409/422 having written nothing.
 *     This is what makes an authorization measurement possible on a destructive route.
 *
 *   NOT usable for a `{ resource, from: 'param' }` route: `ProjectScopeResolver` returns undefined
 *   for a row that does not exist, and `PolicyGuard` then denies with 403 — for a Workspace Admin
 *   too. A bogus id there measures nothing, so those probes use real seeded ids and read-only or
 *   round-trip operations.

  /**
   * Each of these is the reference half of a §3.2 row whose GRID is Hidden for an Editor, and each is
   * a DELIBERATE decision recorded elsewhere — not drift. They are measured here so the audit table
   * shows the whole Editor surface rather than only the refusals:
   *
   *   • `/iterations/options` + `/assignable` — §3.2:80 gives the Editor `Iteration Status | View and
   *     update`, and that screen's picker, the Backlog's iteration filter, Team Status's picker and
   *     Quality's all read them. `timebox:view` is what hides the RECORD list above.
   *   • `/releases/options` — an Editor may already write `PUT :id/milestones` and read the Backlog's
   *     Release column, so the picker has to populate; the authority to MOVE an item between releases
   *     is refused separately (`assertMayAssignRelease`, measured below).
   *   • `/milestones/options` — same shape; `PUT /work-items/:id/milestones` is `work_item:edit`.
   *   • `/portfolio-items/options` — the `Feature` field on a Story. THE BA IS SILENT on whether an
   *     Editor may set it; §5.2:124 makes that field the only way Feature membership is ever set and
   *     §3.2:79 gives them the Story, so this is a declared reading put to the BA. Release is decided
   *     the OTHER way and says so in words (BL §8:294), which is why that one is refused.

  /**
   * THE ONE MEASURED MISMATCH IN THE "a role can do what the BA hides" DIRECTION — NOW CLOSED.

   * This landed as `it.fails` with the note below, on the reasoning that an assertion carrying the
   * BA's rule is worth more failing than weakened. The feed was then narrowed and the marker came
   * off, so the spec now holds the fix instead of describing its absence.
   *
   * §3.1:62 `View company Users | Edit | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden`. `listMemberOptions` uses
   * `listReadableProjectIds` as a BINARY gate — "does this caller have ANY readable project?" — and
   * then returns `memberRepo.listMemberOptions(workspaceId)`, the whole workspace. So a per-project
   * Editor reads every company user's `displayName` and `email`, the same count a Workspace Admin
   * gets. `db/permissions.catalog.ts` describes this route as "scoped in the service by
   * `listReadableProjectIds`", which is true of the gate and false of the projection — the same shape
   * as the Team Status comment that claimed a parity it only half had.
   *
   * HOW IT WAS FIXED, since "narrow it" was not obviously available. The note that shipped with the
   * route argued the population could NOT be narrowed, because `project_members` alone cannot name a
   * project's owner — §2.1 (migration 0118) keeps a Workspace Admin off every roster, and a WA is
   * exactly who tends to own a project. That half was true; the conclusion was not. The population is
   * now the UNION of what a readable project actually references — its active members AND its lead —
   * which resolves every owner the reader can see by construction and still stops being a directory.
   *
   * The route stays 200 rather than becoming a 403: it is the picker feed for surfaces an Editor may
   * legitimately read (the Projects list gives them owner NAMES under §3.1:70 "Read-only, scoped"), so
   * refusing it would empty a column they are entitled to — the trap that made the first roster fix a
   * regression (RBE-07). Reduce the population, not the audience.
