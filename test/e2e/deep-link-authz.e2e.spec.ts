/**
 * A DEEP LINK must be authorized, not merely resolvable — over real HTTP.
 *
 * `mini_rally_project_overview.md` :5 (product-docs `origin/main`): a user with no `project_members`
 * row has "the Project hidden and **direct URLs denied**". That is the security half of the
 * deep-linking requirement the BA lists as failing (`mini_rally_ui_business_review.md` :218, :256),
 * and it is the half a client-side fix cannot provide: the SPA change that goes with this spec makes
 * a link open the record in its OWN project context, which is precisely the change that would be
 * dangerous if the API were not already refusing the records the caller may not read.
 *
 * The two routes here are the ONLY resolvers behind the two entity deep links:
 *
 *   `/item/$itemKey`        → `GET /work-items/by-key`   (no `@RequirePermission`, by design)
 *   `/releases/$releaseId`  → `GET /releases/:id`        (`resource: 'release'` scope resolution)
 *
 * They reach the same answer by two different mechanisms, which is why both are asserted. `by-key`
 * carries no decorator because item keys are workspace-unique, so the owning project is unknown until
 * the row loads — the service resolves the row and THEN calls
 * `assertProjectPermission(work_item:view)`. A decorator here would have to guess the project from
 * the URL, the trap CLAUDE.md names ("a gate chosen for where the id lives rather than for what the
 * action is"). `GET /releases/:id` can express it, because `ProjectScopeResolver` loads the release
 * row for the guard.
 *
 * Three cases per route, because they are three different answers and the SPA branches on them:
 * granted → 200, no access → 403, absent record → 404.
 *
 * Every record used belongs to PAY, the seed's SECOND project. A spec that deep-linked into the
 * principal's own project would pass whether or not the boundary exists.
 *
 * A spec that called the SERVICE could not see any of this — the guard chain would not run. Same
 * blind spot that hid the `report:view` bug and the `by-key` `workspace:view` bug.
