/**
 * `Dev Owner` must SURVIVE a reload, and the surface that edits it must be the surface that reads it.
 *
 * `GAP-P2-IS-004` (BA DEV Handoff retest 2026-08-17, Confirmed Fail): on `Track > Iteration Status`
 * the inline `Dev Owner` dropdown offered a valid user, the write reported success and the name
 * appeared on the row — and after a reload the cell read `No Entry` again.
 *
 * `P2-IS-FR-032C` is the rule: "an Owner/Dev Owner that updated successfully must remain after a
 * refresh or reload". AC3 adds that every surface sharing the Work Item must read the SAME value
 * rather than keeping local state at Iteration Status.
 *
 * Why over real HTTP and why BOTH endpoints in one file: `work_items.dev_owner_id` is written by
 * `PATCH /work-items/:id` and read back by `GET /iteration-status`, which is a DIFFERENT repository
 * with its own projection. Nothing in the suite covered `devOwnerId` at all before this — a
 * service-level spec would have proven the column is writable without proving the screen's own feed
 * returns it, and this defect is exactly the gap between those two claims.
 *
 * Bearer token from `AuthService.devLogin`: Bearer callers are CSRF-exempt by design, and the test app
 * has no `/v1` prefix and no cookie plugin (`reply.setCookie is not a function`).
