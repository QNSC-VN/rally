/**
 * Portfolio cross-project isolation E2E.
 *
 * The Portfolio list is the app's first CROSS-PROJECT list: `projectId` is optional
 * because a Workspace Admin lists Epics/Features across every project (BA spec §3.2) and
 * the grid carries a Project column. That makes the route gate weak by necessity —
 * `portfolio:view` is project-tier, so the PolicyGuard cannot resolve one project to
 * check against and the route only proves the caller may read the workspace.
 *
 * The real boundary is `AccessService.listReadableProjectIds`, applied by
 * `PortfolioItemsService` as a project filter. This spec is what makes that claim real:
 * a caller holding project_admin on project A must see A's portfolio items and must NOT
 * see B's, through the same service path production uses.
 *
 * Mirrors Rally, where access to an artifact follows from permission on its PROJECT
 * rather than from any per-artifact grant — Rally stores one ProjectPermission row per
 * (user, project, workspace) and a Viewer sees everything in that project.
 *
 * Prereqs: docker deps up + `pnpm db:migrate` (see flow-harness).
