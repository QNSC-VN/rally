/**
 * AN OWNER'S NAME IS A PROPERTY OF THE ROW, not of the picker feed the reader can see.
 *
 * Reported 2026-08-22: an Editor saw `No Entry` / `Unassigned` in the Owner and Dev Owner columns of
 * Iteration Status for items that WERE assigned — the detail page showed them, and a Workspace Admin
 * saw them everywhere. Not a permission fault: the grids held ids only and resolved the name client
 * side from a PICKER feed, and every picker feed narrows deliberately.
 *
 *   • `GET /projects/:id/member-options` excludes Workspace Admins — AC-16, they are not assignable
 *     owners — so it can never name one, for ANY role.
 *   • `GET /workspaces/:id/member-options` narrows a non-admin caller to the members and the
 *     `lead_id`s of their own readable projects.
 *
 * A Workspace Admin holds no `work.project_members` row at all (§2.1, migration 0118), so an item they
 * own had no name source in either feed, and an absent name is indistinguishable from an unset field.
 * A Workspace Admin reader never noticed because `listReadableProjectIds` returns `null` — unrestricted
 * — so their directory is the whole workspace.
 *
 * The read models now join the name (`ownerNameJoins`, and the iteration-status projection), which is
 * what Portfolio, Releases, Milestones and Quality already did. These tests assert it over real HTTP
 * for the EDITOR, because the fault only appeared for a narrowed principal — a service-level test with
 * the feeds mocked cannot see it at all.
