/**
 * Rank integrity E2E — a rank must be unique within its scope, always.
 *
 * `rank` is a LexoRank ordering items within ONE scope: the top-level items of a
 * project, or the children of one parent. The same value in two different scopes
 * is correct and expected. Two items sharing a rank inside one scope is not —
 * `between(low, high)` throws when low >= high, so drag-reorder fails outright,
 * and the visible order becomes arbitrary rather than meaningful.
 *
 * Two ways that invariant used to break, both covered here:
 *
 *  1. Concurrent creates. Rank was derived on the pool connection before the
 *     insert transaction opened, with no lock, so simultaneous creates in one
 *     scope read the same max and derived the same rank. Without the fix this
 *     spec sees 2 distinct ranks out of 12.
 *
 *  2. Re-parenting. Moving an item to another parent (or to top level) changes
 *     its scope, and the old rank travelled with it — landing on whatever the
 *     destination's first item already held.
 *
 * Prereqs: docker deps up + `pnpm db:migrate` (see flow-harness).
