/**
 * BA business-flow E2E — E2E-011 Team Status, relation-render guard.
 *
 * Team Status is the screen that went blank in production: seeded work items
 * had team_id NULL, the screen filters tasks by team, and a null relation
 * rendered as "no tasks". The service logic was correct; the RELATED DATA
 * reaching the screen was not — and nothing failed, because no test asserted
 * that a task WITH a full set of relations actually surfaces here.
 *
 * This is that test. It builds one task with every relation set (team, iteration,
 * assignee, parent work product, release) and asserts Team Status returns it
 * grouped under the right member with each relation RESOLVED — not just that the
 * ids are correct. See RELATION_DATA_TRACEABILITY.md §"server-resolved": the
 * failure mode of this architecture is a dropped row or an empty field, silently.
 *
 * Deliberately creates its own fully-linked data rather than trusting the seed,
 * so it guards the query's join/filter regardless of what the seed happens to
 * contain. If the team filter, the iteration filter, or the member grouping
 * regresses, the member group or its task row disappears and this fails.
 *
 * Drives the REAL application services against the seeded DB.
