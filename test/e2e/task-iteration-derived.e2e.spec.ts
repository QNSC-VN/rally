/**
 * A Task's Iteration is DERIVED from its parent, and cannot be made to diverge.
 *
 * The BA states it three times — "A Task inherits Project, Team, Iteration and Release/Milestone
 * context THROUGH ITS PARENT Story/Defect" (BUSINESS_BASELINE), "no independent Iteration selector"
 * (P1-TASK-011), "without an independent Task iteration assignment" (P2-IS-024) — and real Rally
 * shows the field read-only. So this is not a cascade that keeps two values in step; the Task owns
 * no value to keep.
 *
 * Both halves are proven here because both were broken: nothing propagated a parent move, and two
 * separate paths let a caller write the column outright. The last case is the one that matters most
 * — `db/seeds/**` writes `work.tasks` in raw SQL, so a rule the service alone enforced would be a
 * rule the fixtures walk around.
