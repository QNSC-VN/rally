/**
 * PRJ-08 over HTTP: an Editor must have at least one Team, and the combined write is ATOMIC.
 *
 * The rule is `assertTeamAssignmentForLevel` in `libs/modules/access/src/domain/project-access.ts`,
 * reached through `ProjectsService.setProjectAccess` behind `POST /projects/:id/members`. §2.2 states
 * it ("Editor must be assigned to at least one active Team"), so does the §2.2 level table ("One
 * assigned Project and one or more explicitly assigned Teams") and
 * `00_Documents/mini_rally_usecase_role_mapping.md:81`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE UNIT SPEC. `projects.service.spec.ts` covers all four cases against a
 * STUB transaction, and a stub cannot prove a rollback — `uow.run` there just invokes the callback, so
 * "the level did not land" is only ever "the mock was not called". The whole point of the combined
 * endpoint is that the level and the team rows share one real transaction, and the only way to see
 * that is to make a write fail against a real database and then look at the rows. That is the last
 * test in this file.
 *
 * THE TEAMLESS-PROJECT EXEMPTION IS NOT HERE, deliberately: neither seeded project is teamless (the
 * demo seed links Alpha and Beta to NXP, and `second-project.ts` links one to PAY), and creating a
 * project would push `test/e2e-fixtures.ratchet.spec.ts`'s `createProject` cap — a ratchet that may
 * only fall — for a branch of a pure function the unit spec already pins in both directions.
 *
 * No `/v1` prefix: `Test.createTestingModule` builds the app WITHOUT the bootstrap that sets the
 * global prefix. Bearer tokens from `AuthService.devLogin` / `ssoLogin` rather than the BFF, because
 * the test app registers no cookie plugin (`reply.setCookie is not a function`) — and Bearer callers
 * are CSRF-exempt by design, so there is no token dance.
 *
 * THE REFUSAL IS 412, NOT 422. `PreconditionFailedException` maps to `PRECONDITION_FAILED` → 412 in
 * `@qnsc-vn/platform-http`, while every route in this repo declares `@ApiCommonErrors(…, 422)` for a
 * business-rule violation — `HttpErrorCode` in `libs/platform/src/auth/decorators.ts` does not even
 * admit 412. That mismatch is pre-existing and repo-wide (every `PreconditionFailedException` route
 * has it); asserted here as the RUNTIME status so this spec pins what the API actually answers rather
 * than what its Swagger claims.
