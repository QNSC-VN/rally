/**
 * Deleting a timebox UNSCHEDULES its work. It does not orphan it, and it does not delete it.
 *
 * The 2026-08-04 full-stack audit called this its highest-value fix (§1.1) and it was still open on
 * 2026-08-14: `work_items.iteration_id`, `work.tasks.iteration_id`, `work_items.release_id` and
 * `portfolio_items.release_id` carried NO foreign key, and the iteration and release delete services
 * are each a bare `repo.delete(id)` that unschedules nothing. So every scheduled item was left
 * pointing at a row that no longer existed — reachable in normal use, because an iteration in
 * `planning` legally holds items and `planning` is exactly the state the delete gate permits.
 *
 * The milestone case is included but is NOT evidence of the same bug: the repository already deletes
 * its four junction tables in code, so that test passes with or without the new constraint. It is
 * here because the association rule is worth pinning either way, and because those five statements
 * share no transaction — the CASCADE is what makes a partial failure survivable.
 *
 * Rally documents the target behaviour rather than refusing: "If you delete an iteration that
 * stories and defects are scheduled in, **they will all be updated to unscheduled**", and deleting a
 * milestone "removes the association from each work item… The work item itself is not deleted."
 * Broadcom KB 143097 exists *because* the reference is gone afterwards — you have to reconstruct the
 * affected set from Lookback `_PreviousValues`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The fix is a set of `ON DELETE SET NULL` / `CASCADE` keys (migration
 * 0114), which means there is no application code to unit-test: the behaviour is entirely in the
 * database, and a service spec calling `deleteIteration` against a mock would prove nothing. These
 * assertions run against the real schema, which is the only place the invariant lives.
 *
 * Driven through the SERVICES rather than raw SQL, because the point is that an ordinary delete —
 * the one a Workspace Admin performs — leaves the data in the documented state.
