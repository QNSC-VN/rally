/**
 * Manage Filters, over REAL HTTP: every specified filter column is a SERVER predicate.
 *
 * `P2-BL-FR-005` / `-020` and Backlog AC-7 give the Backlog a Manage Filters popover whose chosen
 * columns "combine active filters after Apply"; `P2-IS-FR-022` inherits it on Iteration Status. The
 * requirement that makes it non-trivial is not the popover — it is WHERE the filtering happens.
 *
 * The gap this closes, and the reason the assertions are shaped the way they are:
 *
 *  • The Backlog had Type / Schedule State / Priority / Owner / Release server-side, and NO filter at
 *    all for the ID, Name and Est columns FR-006 names as text/number inputs.
 *  • Iteration Status had `q`, `type`, `scheduleState`, `isBlocked` and `assigneeId` on the API and
 *    used exactly ONE of them (`q`); Schedule State, Owner and Blocked were re-implemented in the
 *    browser over the already-fetched rows. That answers "which of the rows we fetched match?", not
 *    "which rows match?" — the two diverge the moment the set exceeds what was fetched.
 *
 * So the load-bearing assertion in each half is `finds a match that is NOT on the first page`. A test
 * that filters within page one passes just as well against a client-side filter and proves nothing.
 *
 * Driven through `app.inject()` rather than the services, deliberately: the number and boolean filters
 * arrive as QUERY STRINGS, and their coercion is part of the contract. `isBlocked` is the proof —
 * `z.coerce.boolean()` maps `'false'` to TRUE, so `?isBlocked=false` used to ask for blocked rows, and
 * no service-level test could have seen it. Same blind spot CLAUDE.md records for the guard defects.
 *
 * Fixtures live in `SEEDED.nxp` (no `createProject` — `test/e2e-fixtures.ratchet.spec.ts` caps those),
 * and in `SEEDED.nxp.iterationFutureId` rather than the current iteration, whose metrics several other
 * specs read.
