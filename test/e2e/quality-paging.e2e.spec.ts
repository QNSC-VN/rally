/**
 * Quality/Defects list paging.
 *
 * This route had NO automated coverage of any kind, which is how it shipped silently truncated:
 * `DefectQuerySchema` extends `PageQuerySchema`, whose `limit` defaults to 50, the client never sent
 * an offset, and nothing returned a total — so a project with 60 defects served 50 rows that read as
 * the whole list. A grid that lies by omission passes every test that only checks the rows it
 * returned, which is exactly what happened.
 *
 * So these assert the three facts a pager depends on, at the service layer where the window is
 * applied:
 *
 *   1. `total` counts the rows matching the FILTERS, not the page — otherwise "of N" is a lie.
 *   2. `offset` genuinely skips, and page 2 is disjoint from page 1.
 *   3. `total` is invariant across pages, so the footer does not renumber itself as you walk.
 *
 * `metrics` is deliberately NOT asserted against `total`: it is computed over every defect in the
 * project regardless of filters, so the two answer different questions and must be allowed to
 * differ. Conflating them is the mistake this spec exists to prevent.
