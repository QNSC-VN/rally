/**
 * BA business-flow E2E — E2E-002 "Admin prepares team and user for work management".
 *
 * This flow had NO automated coverage, and its absence is why the manual BA run
 * collapsed: tracker checkpoints 00, 01 and 04 were all blocked by "Team is not
 * linked to this project" (gaps DEV-003 / DEV-007). The team↔project link was
 * missing from the environment and nothing failed until a human tried to create
 * a work item.
 *
 * NOTE on numbering — the tracker's execution checkpoints (two digits, in
 * BUSINESS_E2E_TEST_TRACKER.xlsx) and the business flows (three digits, in
 * E2E_BUSINESS_FLOW_COVERAGE.md) are DIFFERENT schemes that look alike. Only
 * three-digit flow ids are written in the citable form in these specs, so the
 * traceability matrix can be extracted mechanically without false matches.
 *
 * Encodes the business rules verbatim from
 * 04_Developement_tracking/Phase 1/08_Manage_Projects_Teams_Users/SRS.md §2A:
 *
 *   - "a Team must be linked to at least one active Project before it can be
 *      selected in Backlog/Create/Detail flows"
 *   - "User project access is derived from team membership. The User management
 *      screen must not assign projects directly to a user."
 *   - "Work Item Project and Team must be a valid pair. If a user selects
 *      Project NXP, the Team dropdown can only show teams linked to NXP."
 *   - TEAM-FR-006 "Saving creates team and links it to selected project."
 *   - TEAM-FR-004 "Team key is normalized uppercase and validated unique."
 *
 * Each test asserts a rule that a wrong implementation would actually violate —
 * an unlinked team must be REJECTED, a cross-project team must be REJECTED, and
 * the prepared context must be USABLE by the Backlog. Asserting only that calls
 * succeed would have passed against the very state that blocked the BA run.
 *
 * NOT duplicated here: team key normalisation (TEAM-FR-004), duplicate-key
 * rejection, and project↔team link/unlink idempotency (TEAM-FR-006) are already
 * proven by workspace-foundation-flow.e2e.spec.ts, which asserts strictly more
 * in each case. This spec starts where that one stops — at the rules that only
 * matter once a team is actually being USED for work management.
 *
 * Drives the REAL application services against the seeded DB.

   * ORDER REVERSED, 2026-08-21 — read this before "fixing" either half.
   *
   * §2A says "User project access is derived from team membership", and this block used to prove it by
   * adding a workspace user with NO project access straight to a linked team. The BA's report of
   * 2026-08-21 states the opposite for that write: the Add Member modal "lists only active users who
   * already belong to the selected Project", and "Backend validation must also reject adding a user
   * who does not belong to the Project" (`TEAM_MEMBER_NOT_PROJECT_MEMBER`).
   *
   * The two cannot both hold on `addTeamMember`, and the newer instruction wins — the same precedence
   * this repo applied to the defect-delete and Rollup reversals. What survives of §2A is the DERIVING
   * itself, on the path the BA's own E2E-002 uses: `createTeam` with `memberUserIds` still grants
   * project access through RBE-06 ("Create Team under a Project and select one existing user as
   * Editor"), and a roster row still implies access for everyone it admits. What changed is that an
   * EXISTING team can no longer be the first place a user meets a project: grant access, then staff
   * the team.
   *
   * PUT TO THE BA. If they want §2A's order restored, the refusal in `TeamService.addTeamMember` is
   * the one predicate to remove, and this block goes back to asserting the add succeeds.
