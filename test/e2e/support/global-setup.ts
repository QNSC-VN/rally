/**
 * ONE reset for the whole BE e2e run: truncate the delivery tables, then re-seed the two fixtures.
 *
 * Why this exists. Every `afterAll` in the suite closed the Nest app and cleaned NOTHING — 37 files,
 * zero teardown — while the files between them called `createProject` 84 times per run. So a dev
 * database grew by ~84 projects and their whole graph on every pass, forever. Two consequences, both
 * observed:
 *
 *   • `portfolio_items.rank` is `varchar(255)` and new ranks are derived by appending, so at ~1,900
 *     items the longest rank hit exactly 255 characters and EVERY subsequent insert failed with
 *     `value too long for type character varying(255)`. The suite could not run at all until the
 *     database was dropped by hand. That happened twice.
 *   • Tests read each other's leftovers. A list assertion that was true on a clean database becomes
 *     order-dependent once fifty other projects exist, and the failure surfaces in an unrelated file.
 *
 * Truncate rather than per-test teardown: teardown has to unwind foreign keys in the right order in
 * every file that creates anything, which is exactly the discipline that never held. One `TRUNCATE
 * ... CASCADE` at the start of the run is a single place to be correct.
 *
 * What is NOT truncated: `identity.*`, `access.*` and `workspace.*`. Users, roles, grants and the
 * workspace itself are the ground the fixtures stand on, `bootstrap.ts` reconciles them idempotently,
 * and dropping a role would take its assignments — including the ones `ensureViewerGrant` relies on.
 *
 * THE CACHE HAS TO GO TOO, and that is not obvious. `AccessService.effectiveAssignments` caches a
 * user's resolved grants in Valkey under `authz:assign:<workspace>:<user>` for five minutes. The
 * truncate restores the DATABASE and says nothing to the cache, so for five minutes after any run
 * the suite answers authorization questions from the PREVIOUS run's state.
 *
 * That is not theoretical: it was found by a spec that granted `dev@qnsc.dev` `access_level:'admin'`
 * on NXP. The reset put the row back to `editor`, and the very next spec still resolved `admin` and
 * was served a roster an Editor must be refused — a false PASS on an access-control assertion, which
 * is the worst direction for this class of test to be wrong in. Flushing here makes each run start
 * from the database it just seeded.

/**
 * Drop every cached permission resolution, so the suite reads the database it just seeded.
 *
 * `FLUSHDB`, not a `SCAN` + `DEL` over `authz:assign:*`: the cache primitive is free to prefix its
 * keys, and a pattern that silently matches nothing would leave exactly the staleness this is here
 * to remove while looking like it worked. Everything in this database is derived — permission
 * resolutions, rate-limit counters, BFF sessions — and the e2e suite mints its own bearer tokens
 * through `AuthService.devLogin`, so none of it is state a test depends on surviving.
 *
 * Never fatal. If Valkey is down the suite should fail on the assertion that needs it, with that
 * spec's own message, rather than on an opaque error in global setup — and `AccessService` degrades
 * to the database on a cache miss, so a flush that did not happen costs correctness only for the
 * five-minute TTL, which is the situation this function improves rather than guarantees.
