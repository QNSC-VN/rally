/**
 * Cross-project READS are scoped to what the caller may see.
 *
 * `GET /v1/projects` carried no `@RequirePermission`, and its query filtered on `workspace_id` +
 * `deleted_at IS NULL` and nothing else — so every project's key, name, description, owner, dates and
 * counts was readable by any authenticated principal, including one with zero role assignments.
 * PRJ-FR-001 requires "List chỉ project user được phép truy cập trong workspace hiện tại", and §10 is
 * explicit that workspace membership alone does not confer project visibility.
 *
 * `GET /v1/projects/:id/members` was open for the same reason — a route with no metadata is OPEN — so
 * the roster of a project the caller cannot see came back too.
 *
 * Driven over real HTTP with the roles that hit these boundaries: a service-level call skips
 * `PolicyGuard`, and the guard is half of what is being asserted.
