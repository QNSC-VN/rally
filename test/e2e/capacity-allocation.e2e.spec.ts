/**
 * Capacity allocation E2E — the metric definitions, against real SQL.
 *
 * These exist because the numbers follow RALLY'S rule, and only a real database can show
 * whether the SQL implements it (Broadcom TechDocs, "View Capacity Plan Details"): "If a
 * portfolio item includes allocated points/counts, the Project and Release fields in the
 * story must match the plan for that story to be included in the Rollup calculation" —
 * and the identical sentence for Complete.
 *
 * Three consequences are asserted here and cannot be seen from a unit test:
 *
 *   • a child story in ANOTHER release does not count, even though it belongs to the
 *     allocated Feature — without that filter every plan touching a long-lived Feature
 *     reports inflated demand;
 *   • a Feature SHARED between teams is not double-counted: Rally attributes a story by its
 *     Project, which in Rally's model is the team, so each team sees only its own children;
 *   • `Complete` uses COMPLETED_SCHEDULE_STATES while the portfolio's Percent Done uses
 *     ACCEPTED_SCHEDULE_STATES — the D1 distinction, which must stay different.
 *
 * Prereqs: docker deps up + `pnpm db:migrate` (see flow-harness).
