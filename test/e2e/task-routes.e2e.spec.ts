/**
 * A Task's own id, over REAL HTTP, through the guard.
 *
 * The gap this closes. `ProjectScopeResolver` mapped the `work_item` resource kind to the
 * `work_items` table, but tasks moved out of it at the Phase 3 split (migration 0072: "nothing
 * inserts a task into work_items"). The ROUTES did not split with them — `PATCH /work-items/:id`,
 * `/:id/activity`, `/:id/attachments`, `/:id/watchers` and `PATCH /team-status/tasks/:taskId` all
 * take a task's own id. So `@RequirePermission(..., { resource: 'work_item', from: 'param' })`
 * resolved nothing and the guard threw `WORK_ITEM_NOT_FOUND` before the handler ran — as a Workspace
 * Admin, so permission never entered into it.
 *
 * Measured before the fix: GET, `/activity` and `/attachments` on a task all answered 404 while the
 * parent story answered 200. A Task was therefore uneditable everywhere (Tasks tab, Task Detail,
 * Team Status), its Revision History permanently empty and its attachments unreachable — four Phase 1
 * SRS contracts dead on one line of table mapping.
 *
 * Why no existing test saw it: every task spec calls `WorkItemsService` directly, which skips
 * `PolicyGuard` entirely. This one drives `app.inject()` for the same reason
 * `report-authz.e2e.spec.ts` does — a guard defect is only visible from the outside.
