/**
 * The five report routes, over REAL HTTP, proving `report:view` actually denies.
 *
 * The gap this closes: every existing reporting assertion calls `ReportingService` directly as a
 * workspace admin. The decorators on `reporting.controller.ts` were therefore proven only to EXIST —
 * `test/route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts` counts undecorated handlers by reading source text, which cannot
 * tell a correct `@RequirePermission` from a misspelled one, a wrong code, or a project-tier code
 * whose scope resolves from the wrong field.
 *
 * That mattered: `report:view` reached the catalogue in Phase 6 but never reached an existing
 * workspace's tier roles (`db/seeds/bootstrap.ts` upserts them with `set: { name }`), so every report
 * answered 403 to everyone except Workspace Admin — whose `workspace:*` grant is the global anchor and
 * hid it in every test. Migration 0092 fixed the data; this proves the boundary itself, in both
 * directions, on the only surface a browser can reach.
 *
 * Boots the REAL `AppModule` and drives `app.inject()`, so the guard chain, the cached permission
 * resolution and the route all run as in production. The one stub is the Microsoft signature check,
 * which cannot be satisfied locally.
