/**
 * The Items tab and Rally's cutline — real SQL.
 *
 * Rally: "Items above the cutline fit within the defined plan capacity… The cutline only
 * displays when you sort portfolio items by rank in ascending order" (Broadcom TechDocs,
 * Capacity Plan Items Tab). So the line is PLAN-wide, over one row per Feature, in rank order.
 *
 * Real SQL because two of the three inputs come from the database and cannot be faked
 * convincingly: the Feature's LexoRank (which decides the order the line accumulates down) and
 * `itemRollup` — the Feature's OWN child totals across every team, which is a different query
 * from the per-team slice the team rows use.
 *
 * Prereqs: docker deps up + `pnpm db:migrate` (see flow-harness).
