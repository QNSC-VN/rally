/**
 * The user DIRECTORY and the TEAM reads, over REAL HTTP, in both directions (RBE-07, RBE-08/PRJ-07).
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG
 *   • `GET /workspaces/:id/members-with-profile` was the codebase's single `@AuthzGap` — no
 *     authorization at all, and `PolicyGuard` ALLOWS a handler with no policy metadata. Every
 *     member's `phone`, `lastLoginAt` and role ids were readable by a per-project Editor and by a
 *     No Access principal (nobody with an active `project_members` row anywhere).
 *   • `GET /workspaces/:id/teams`, `GET /teams/:id` and `GET /teams/:id/members` carried nothing
 *     either, so every team's name, key, lead, member count, the name and key of every project it
 *     links to, and the roster's display names AND EMAILS were readable by any authenticated caller.
 *     §3.1 makes "View Project Details and Teams" a per-Project row.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE AND NOT ONLY A SERVICE SPEC
 * The team and picker checks are `@AuthorizedInService`, so a service spec CAN see them, and
 * `libs/modules/workspace/src/application/{team,workspace}.service.spec.ts` assert the sentinels with
 * mocks. What a service spec cannot see is the GUARD: whether `workspace:view` on
 * `members-with-profile` really refuses an Editor through `PolicyGuard`, with a real cached
 * permission resolution, on the only surface a browser can reach. CLAUDE.md records that blind spot
 * twice. `test/roster-split-gate.spec.ts` reads the decorator metadata in the unit suite; this drives
 * the routes.
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS, and the second is the one that matters here: over-restricting the picker feed
 * silently breaks every owner and assignee picker on Portfolio and Projects, which is exactly the
 * risk that deferred this fix once already. So each test that asserts a refusal has a sibling that
 * asserts an Editor still reads what they need.
 *
 * NOTES THAT COST SOMEONE AN HOUR BEFORE
 *   • No `/v1` prefix: `Test.createTestingModule` builds the app WITHOUT the bootstrap that sets the
 *     global prefix, so routes are mounted bare. A missing prefix reads as a 404, which must never be
 *     confused with a refusal — hence the explicit 403 / 404 / 200 assertions rather than "not 200".
 *   • No cookie plugin either, so `AuthService.devLogin` / `ssoLogin` for a bearer token rather than
 *     the BFF route (`reply.setCookie is not a function`). Bearer callers are CSRF-exempt by design.
 *   • A dedicated principal per test, never `dev@qnsc.dev`: `work.project_members` survives until the
 *     next reset, so granting a shared fixture user a level is a lasting edit that has broken other
 *     specs before.
