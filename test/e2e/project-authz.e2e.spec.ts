/**
 * The project-scoped route surface, over REAL HTTP, in BOTH directions.
 *
 * This is the spec that twelve `@AuthorizedInService(reason, pinnedBy)` decorators across
 * `projects.controller.ts`, `work-items.controller.ts` and `portfolio-items.controller.ts` name as
 * their proof. It did not exist. That is worse than an undecorated route: the boot audit
 * (`RouteAuthzAudit`) accepts `@AuthorizedInService` *because* a test is named, and
 * `route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts` counted the decorator as a declaration — so a dozen routes,
 * including `GET /projects` (whose ONLY authorization is `listReadableProjectIds`), carried a
 * citation that read as evidence and asserted nothing. The ratchet now fails when a cited spec is
 * missing; this is the file it was asking for.
 *
 * WHAT IT PINS, beyond the routes themselves
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Two P0 access defects found on 2026-08-14, which are one defect seen from two ends — the
 * workspace BASELINE was doing a job it cannot do:
 *
 *   1. Per-Project grants live in `work.project_members.access_level` and are synthesized as
 *      PROJECT-scoped assignments. `GET /bff/me` returns only the workspace baseline, and
 *      migration 0111 deleted the workspace-scoped tier assignments — so a correctly-provisioned
 *      Admin or Editor arrived at the SPA with an empty permission set and no navigation at all.
 *   2. `getUserRoleAndPermissions` floored that empty baseline at `[workspace:view]` "so the app
 *      shell works". `workspace:view` gates `GET /workspaces/:id/settings` and the two SCM
 *      inventory routes — all admin-only — so the floor handed every user, No Access included, a
 *      code that opens three admin surfaces.
 *
 * Both are asserted here: the Editor and No Access cases prove (2) is gone, and the Editor's 200s
 * prove the project-tier path that (1) broke is real and reachable.
 *
 * WHY THE SEED HAD TO CHANGE FIRST
 * --------------------------------
 * `db/seeds/demo.ts` granted `dev@qnsc.dev` the `project_member` tier role at WORKSPACE scope —
 * exactly the row migration 0111 deletes as "pure legacy over-grant" — so a developer held the
 * full Editor delivery set in every project and the project-scoped path was never exercised.
 * `read-scoping.e2e.spec.ts` says so in a comment: "the honest expectation here is not 'fewer
 * projects'". With that grant gone, `dev@qnsc.dev` is an Editor on NXP and nothing anywhere else,
 * which is what makes a negative assertion possible at all. Same masking shape as `report:view`
 * (see CLAUDE.md): a principal with too much hides a broken gate from every test.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THIS HARNESS GETS RIGHT, EACH LEARNED THE HARD WAY (see report-authz.e2e.spec.ts)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  - **No `/v1` prefix.** `Test.createTestingModule` skips the bootstrap that sets the global
 *    prefix, so routes mount bare. Getting it wrong reads as a 404 — indistinguishable from a
 *    refusal, which is why every assertion below names the status it expects.
 *  - **`AuthService.devLogin`, not the BFF route.** The BFF sets a `__Host-` cookie via
 *    `reply.setCookie`, and the cookie plugin is not registered here, so that path 500s.
 *  - **A seeded user, not an SSO login,** wherever a NEGATIVE case is asserted — except for the No
 *    Access principal, where JIT provisioning is the point: `ensureDefaultRole` is a no-op, so a
 *    first SSO sign-in IS the BA's implicit No Access and needs no fixture.
