/**
 * An ACCEPTED item with no `accepted_date` is a DATA-QUALITY fault, and Velocity must say so rather
 * than guess which bucket its points belong in.
 *
 * `P6-VEL-008`, and the BA's own instruction is why this file exists rather than a fixture on DevInt:
 * "Không seed dữ liệu lỗi vào DevInt dùng chung" — do not seed the broken row into the shared
 * environment. So the isolated environment is this suite, which runs against a local/CI database and
 * resets it, and the evidence for the retest workbook is this file's output.
 *
 * WHAT IT HAS TO PROVE, from Velocity SRS §3 and the BA's expected result:
 *   1. the points land in `unclassified`, not in During / After / Not Accepted;
 *   2. the report SAYS a data-quality gap exists (`unclassifiedItems`), so a reader cannot mistake the
 *      shorter bar for a real measurement;
 *   3. the offending Work Item is identifiable, so DEV can backfill it from audit history.
 *
 * `velocity.spec.ts` already pins the CLASSIFIER over this shape. What it cannot show is that the row
 * survives the write path and reaches the HTTP response that way — `trg_sync_accepted_date` stamps
 * `now()` on entry to acceptance, so the invalid state is not even reachable through the API. It takes
 * a deliberate `UPDATE … SET accepted_date = NULL`, which the trigger leaves alone by design ("an
 * explicit correction"). That is exactly the shape of a legacy row from before migration 0087, which
 * is the population `pnpm db:backfill:accepted-date` exists for.
