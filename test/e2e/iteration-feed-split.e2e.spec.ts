/**
 * `GET /iterations` answers a DIFFERENT question from the two compact feeds, and its audience is
 * different too. Over real HTTP, in both directions, with a real per-project Editor.
 *
 * THE DEFECT (the unfinished half of RBE-09 / P23-08 / P01-11)
 * `iteration:view` is a code EVERY per-project access level holds, and an Editor must hold it:
 * Iteration Status, the Backlog's iteration filter, Team Status and Quality all need to name an
 * iteration, and §3.2 grants an Editor all four surfaces. But `GET /iterations` returns the timebox
 * RECORD — `goal`, `theme`, `notes`, `plannedVelocity` — and §3.2 marks `Plan > Timeboxes` **Hidden**
 * for an Editor, which is the entire reason `timebox:view` exists. The first split separated the
 * SURFACE (`GET /iterations/:id` and its revision history) and left the FEED behind, so the Editor
 * went on reading the record from the list.
 *
 * WHY TWO NEW ROUTES AND NOT ONE FLAG
 * Two questions were conflated in one endpoint:
 *   • REFERENCE   "what is this iteration called, and when was it?"  every state, plus `teamId`
 *   • ELIGIBILITY "which iterations may I assign work INTO?"         every state, no `teamId`
 * `GET /iterations/options` used to answer the second, which is exactly why the pickers could not use
 * it — an ACCEPTED iteration must still resolve to a name, and it could not offer one. A
 * `?includeAllStates` flag would have let one caller measure a population while a sibling caller
 * enumerated another; CLAUDE.md records that conflation producing zero-point Velocity bars, so
 * `/options` took the REFERENCE meaning it already carries for releases, milestones, portfolio items
 * and member options, and eligibility moved to `/assignable`.
 *
 * Eligibility's `planning | committed` predicate is GONE (P6-VEL-004, BA retest 2026-08-17) — it never
 * matched the write rule, and the test below asserts the reverse of what it once did.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ADDS OVER THE SPECS THAT ALREADY EXIST
 *   • `test/iteration-timebox-gate.spec.ts` reads decorator METADATA. It cannot see a `scope` that
 *     resolves the project from the wrong field, and CLAUDE.md records twice that "a spec that calls
 *     a service directly cannot see a guard defect".
 *   • `test/route-audience.ratchet.spec.ts` reads the response DTO's zod shape. It proves the
 *     reference schema declares no administration field; it cannot prove the HANDLER returns that
 *     schema, and a mapper that spread the row would satisfy it.
 *   • `test/e2e/authz-cluster.e2e.spec.ts` holds the gate half of the §3.2 rows. This file holds the
 *     POPULATION half, which is the property the split exists for and which no gate test can see.
 *
 * Bearer tokens from `AuthService.devLogin`: Bearer callers are CSRF-exempt by design, and the test
 * app has no `/v1` prefix and no cookie plugin (`reply.setCookie is not a function`).
