/**
 * BA business-flow E2E — E2E-010 "Deferred scope guard" and E2E-016 "Future
 * Backlog scope guard".
 *
 * Both had no automated coverage. They are unusual tests: they assert what must
 * stay ABSENT. Scope creep is invisible to ordinary tests — a feature arriving
 * early makes every existing assertion pass — so without a guard the only thing
 * standing between deferred work and the product is somebody remembering.
 *
 * Rules encoded, from
 * 07_Test Business/specs/E2E_BUSINESS_FLOW_COVERAGE.md:
 *
 *   E2E-010: "Backlog create supports Story/Defect only in Phase 1/2."
 *   E2E-016: "Phase 3 Release list/detail has no Release Progress column,
 *             percentage or widget."
 *
 * Scope note — these run at the service/API layer, which is where a deferred
 * field would actually have to appear before a screen could render it. Purely
 * presentational parts of the flows (Portfolio dropdown contents, an Iteration
 * Status Board toggle, Team Board placeholders) are not observable here and are
 * deliberately left to UI review rather than asserted with a proxy that would
 * pass while the real surface regressed.
 *
 * Drives the REAL application services against the seeded DB.
