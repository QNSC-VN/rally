/**
 * The Parent Story picker offers exactly the Stories the write path accepts. Over real HTTP.
 *
 * THE DEFECT (BA repro, Production, verified 2026-08-21)
 * Opening a Defect's `Parent Story` field offered nothing but `No parent story`, and searching a
 * Story's key answered `No matches`, so a Defect could not be traced to the User Story it was found
 * against. All three Parent Story surfaces — the detail sidebar, Create Work Item, and Log Defect —
 * fed the picker from `GET /work-items/backlog?type=story`. That endpoint is the Backlog SCREEN's
 * feed and carries that screen's DEFINING rule, `iteration_id IS NULL`, plus a 50-row first page.
 * `updateWorkItem` has no such rule: it accepts any non-deleted Story in the same project. So every
 * Story that had been pulled into a sprint — which is most of them, and precisely the ones a Defect
 * is raised against — was withheld from a picker whose own server would have taken it.
 *
 * Same class of fault as `listAssignmentOptions`' old `state IN ('planning','committed')` filter
 * (P6-VEL-004): a feed narrower than the write it feeds. CLAUDE.md records the rule that settles
 * both — "an iteration is assignable by SCOPE, never by LIFECYCLE" — and this is its Story analogue.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE AND NOT A SERVICE SPEC
 * The population is the whole property. `work-items.service.spec.ts` mocks the repository, so it
 * cannot see which rows a predicate admits; `route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts` reads source text, so it
 * cannot see a feed at all. CLAUDE.md states it twice: "a spec that calls a service directly cannot
 * see a guard defect", and a decorator is a note, not a check.
 *
 * Bearer tokens from `AuthService.devLogin`: Bearer callers are CSRF-exempt by design, and the test
 * app has no `/v1` prefix and no cookie plugin (`reply.setCookie is not a function`).
