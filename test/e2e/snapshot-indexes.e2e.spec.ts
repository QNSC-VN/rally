/**
 * The snapshot tables' unique indexes, asserted against the LIVE database.
 *
 * `db/schema/*` and `db/migrations/*.sql` are maintained by hand and must agree (CLAUDE.md). They did
 * not: both snapshot tables are created with a `COALESCE(team_id, nil)` unique index — because
 * `team_id IS NULL` is the All Teams row and a plain unique index does not dedupe NULLs — while the
 * schema declared three plain columns. A regenerated migration would have "corrected" the database to
 * the plain form and silently broken the daily job's idempotent upsert: two ticks, two All Teams rows,
 * and a chart that double-counts every day.
 *
 * Comparing the declaration to the database is the only check that catches that. A spec over the
 * schema file alone would just assert that the file says what the file says.
