/**
 * Deleting an archived Team — the destructive half of the workspace Archive surface.
 *
 * The product owner asked for archived Projects and Teams to have a visible home where they can be
 * DELETED. For a team that is not a free action: DB design §488 is "Archive Team does not delete the
 * linked Work Item/Sprint history", and the schema cannot enforce it either way. `work_items.team_id`,
 * `tasks.team_id`, `iterations.team_id` and `portfolio_items.team_id` carry NO foreign key, so a delete
 * dangles them silently; `member_capacity`, `iteration_daily_snapshots` and the two baseline tables are
 * `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so Postgres would happily destroy frozen report history. So the rule is delete
 * ONLY when there is nothing to destroy, and this file is where that is proven against a real database
 * — a mocked repository cannot show that the row and its roster are actually gone, or that a team
 * holding real seeded work is actually refused.
 *
 * Bearer token from `AuthService.devLogin`: Bearer callers are CSRF-exempt by design, and the test app
 * has no `/v1` prefix and no cookie plugin (`reply.setCookie is not a function`).
