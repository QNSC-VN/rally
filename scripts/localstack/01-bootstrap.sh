# LocalStack bootstrap — provisions the S3 buckets the Rally API and worker expect.
#
# Runs automatically via the /etc/localstack/init/ready.d hook every time
# LocalStack becomes ready (mounted from ./scripts/localstack in
# docker-compose.dev.yml). Mirrors how db/init/ bootstraps Postgres.
#
# Idempotent: create-bucket's BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou is swallowed explicitly, so

#   S3 buckets (mirrors the Cloudflare R2 buckets in platform/storage-*):
#     rally-attachments    — PRIVATE. Every permission-gated upload.
#     rally-public-assets  — PUBLIC. Avatars / logos only.
#
#   Without these, attachment upload could not be exercised locally at all,
#   which is how a frontend/backend contract mismatch went unnoticed.
#
# THIS SCRIPT USED TO PROVISION AN SNS TOPIC AND FOUR SQS QUEUES, and that is the
# cautionary tale worth keeping: it subscribed all four queues, unfiltered, with
# RawMessageDelivery=true, while the Terraform subscribed ONE, filtered on event
# types the code never emits, with envelope delivery. Local dev therefore worked
# perfectly and every deployed environment dropped 100% of domain events, unseen,
# for as long as the pipeline existed. The audit projection is a DB-to-DB relay now
# (apps/worker/src/audit/audit-projection.relay.ts) so there is no second topology
# to keep in agreement. If a queue is ever reintroduced, DERIVE this file from the
# Terraform or test against the deployed topology — a hand-written local
# approximation that is more permissive than production is worse than none.
#
# Names / region are kept in sync with .env (S3_ATTACHMENTS_BUCKET,
# S3_PUBLIC_ASSETS_BUCKET).
