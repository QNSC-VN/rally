/**
 * Repair `work_items.accepted_date` for rows that were accepted BEFORE the trigger existed.
 *
 * Velocity classifies a point as During / After / Not Accepted from `accepted_date`, and refuses to
 * guess: an accepted row with no timestamp is reported as `unclassified` rather than silently placed in
 * a bucket. `trg_sync_accepted_date` (migration 0087) maintains the column from then on, but it
 * deliberately invents nothing for rows that were already accepted — Velocity SRS §3 assigns DEV a
 * backfill "from auditable history", and this is it.
 *
 * The history is `work.activity_logs`: every schedule-state change writes
 * `{ field: 'scheduleState', old, new }` with a `created_at`. The acceptance moment is the LATEST
 * transition INTO an accepted-equivalent state — latest, not earliest, because an item can be accepted,
 * reopened and accepted again, and the current state was established by the most recent one.
 *
 * What it will NOT do:
 *   • touch a row that already has a timestamp — the trigger owns those, and overwriting audited data
 *     to make a chart tidier is exactly the fabrication the SRS forbids;
 *   • invent a date for a row with no such history. Those are REPORTED and left NULL, so they keep
 *     showing as `unclassified`, which is true. A synthesised date would move real points into a real
 *     bucket on no evidence.
 *
 * Run: `pnpm db:backfill:accepted-date` (add `--dry-run` to report without writing).
