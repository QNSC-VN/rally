/**
 * REPORT every custom role, everyone holding one, and every workspace-scoped tier assignment.
 *
 * This writes NOTHING, ever, and that is the point. Custom roles and the editable permission matrix
 * were deleted by ruling (2026-08-14, AC-11): `db/permissions.catalog.ts` is the single source of truth
 * a custom matrix would fork, and custom-role CRUD plus WORKSPACE-scoped tier-role assignment together
 * re-create exactly the company-wide over-grant migration 0111 removed. The editing routes and the dead
 * UI are already gone.
 *
 * The DATA is a separate, gated step, because **deleting a role a user currently HOLDS revokes their
 * access**. So the sequence is: remove the routes (done), read this report against a real database, and
 * only then write the migration that removes the rows — converting any real assignment to its
 * per-project equivalent. Guessing at that conversion from an empty local database is how a migration
 * silently takes someone's access away; the `pnpm db:backfill:accepted-date` precedent is the same
 * discipline (report, never guess).
 *
 * **`is_system = false` is NOT the custom-role predicate, and getting that wrong is dangerous.**
 * `db/seeds/bootstrap.ts` creates a workspace-owned, EDITABLE copy of each tier role, and those rows
 * carry `is_system = false` too — on a seeded database `project_admin` (31 permissions) and
 * `project_member` (8) sit right beside the genuine customs. A report keyed on that flag would list the
 * two roles the entire access model depends on as deletable, and a migration acting on it would remove
 * them. The discriminator is the SLUG: anything outside `SYSTEM_ROLE` is custom.
 *
 * Two things this report is looking for, and they are not the same:
 *   • A CUSTOM role — a slug the catalogue does not define. Its permission set exists nowhere in
 *     `db/permissions.catalog.ts`, so nothing can re-derive it after deletion; if anyone holds one, its
 *     codes have to be read here and mapped by hand.
 *   • A WORKSPACE-scoped assignment of any role, custom or not. That is the over-grant shape itself: a
 *     project-tier code held across every project in the workspace, which the per-project model
 *     (`work.project_members.access_level`) expresses per project or not at all.
 *
 * An empty report is the expected result on a seeded database and is NOT proof the migration is safe on
 * a deployed one — run it against every environment before writing that migration.
 *
 * Run: `pnpm db:report:custom-roles`
